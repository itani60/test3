# Logo Image Instructions

To use a custom logo image:

1. Place your logo image file in this assets folder
2. Name it "logo.png" (or update the HTML src attribute)
3. Recommended dimensions: 200x50 pixels or similar aspect ratio
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG

The CSS is already configured to:
- Make the logo white to match the header background
- Add hover effects with golden glow
- Scale appropriately on mobile devices
- Maintain aspect ratio

If you don't have a logo yet, you can:
- Use any image file and rename it to "logo.png"
- Create a simple logo using online tools
- Use a placeholder service like placeholder.com

Example placeholder URL: https://via.placeholder.com/200x50/667eea/ffffff?text=CHP
